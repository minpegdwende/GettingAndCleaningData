# Final output

## Name of the attributes

According to what was demanded, we had 361 for the measurements. But after deletion of certains, we land to 79. The names have been kept readable (in fact "-std()" is just replaced by "Std"" ).
The labels of the activities are kept as they are in the activity labels file.


## Produced file

The final output "tidy_data.txt" contains an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
